# Tutors+ Application
The Maltese culture has always encouraged students to perfect their studies and attend private tuition in order to achieve their academic goals. With an increasing population, this academic sector is seeing a huge rise in numbers and countless students are now in need of tuition. Currently, there lacks a dedicated platform aimed at helping these individuals to find tuition, along with tutors that have no professional means of promoting themselves. This project focuses on the development of the Tutors+ app using Flutter as the development environment of choice along with Firestore, for cloud storage. To enhance the project, AI concepts like those of user profiling, recommender systems, geolocation and more, are applied within the app; All of which help to facilitate the requirement of providing this essential one-stop-shop for all stakeholders making use of the application, in an efficient and smart manner.
